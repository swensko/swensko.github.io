                            <p>In my three years with Taco Bell I learned a lot about how to make myself a good asset to a team. I worked my butt off and got promoted really fast, after about six months. I helped foster good habits and work culture in the restaurant, and another location was begging for my help. I went, and helped them improve their habits and attitudes. It was hard work but I did it with a good heart and I hope my impact lasted.</p>
                            <p>I ended up quitting Taco Bell to downgrade to a part time job (50+ hours per week and school wasn't working for me), even though it was the highest pay-rate I have seen yet due to my success.</p>

                            <p>I'm a great addition to any team. I'm dependable, punctual, and always doing what I can to help!

I'm not one to slack on side-work either!</p>

                            <p>I've been working part time and taking classes at Mott. I'm close to finishing an Associates degree in IT called Computer Occupations Technology. I've covered a pretty broad range of topics here though. Soft skills like End User Support and Psychology are more useful to the IT field than you might assume. I've also taken programming classes in Python, C, and C#. General computer courses that I thought would be a breeze have actually taught me a lot about computer security and networking.</p>

                    <p>I'm a self-learner by nature and computers have always been an interest of mine. I built my first computer when I was 12 years old and have since build more expensive and complex rigs. I've set up tons of different configurations of printers, monitors, and networks.</p>
                    <p>I have a lot of random knowledge - I was the captain of the quiz-bowl team in high school. That and my ability to find answers online make me pretty good at troubleshooting most problems.</p>

                    <p>I'm a computer nerd and gamer by nature - World of Warcraft and D&D. I'm my own chef/baker (I love cookies!). I like to go hiking, camping, or just sit in the hammock and read a book.</p>
                    <p>My laptops all run a very personally configured version of linux that I have spent a lot of time tinkering with. As a result I have adapted a comfortable workflow that uses mainly just the keyboard, it's a lot quicker. I also like to program. I write tons of little scripts to automate things or to perform monotonous calculations for me.</p>
